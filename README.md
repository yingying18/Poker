namefeature : Personal Branches cloned from develop

Helpful: Notify team members on what you are working on if not already assigned to avoid too many merge conflicts

PR requests:
- I suggest we only have 2-3 people max who are responsible for master merging from development.
- Once a branch is ready and would like to merge it into development, make a Pull Request into develop and have at least 1 other person Review it
- Generally someone else should merge the code into develop other than the person who wrote it.



### Note that the milestone folders have been moved to their branch named milestones. 
### This is to keep them off the master/production branch so they are cleaner.
